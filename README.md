Exercises for learning Python

If you want to play piano, you must practice on a piano. If you want to speak French, you must speak 
in French. If you want to code in Python, you must code in Python. 

The best way to learn to code is to take any information you can get from a course, 
video or book and actually use it to code. The more time you spend coding and solving
problems, the more comfortable you will get with Python. These exercises are building functions
that will reinforce what you have learned. Each function has data sets to test if your code works. That feedback
will help you understand your mistakes and you will improve. Some functions may take several hours and
others may take less. Every function you get correct will bring you closer to mastery.



These exercises were taken from Free Code Camp (https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and changed slightly to work on 
Jupyter notebooks.

Try to work the problems before looking at the answers.

Free free to submit different(and probably better) solutions.

Also, feel free to add new pages for different types of problems.

To use Jupyter notebooks go to their website and install (http://jupyter.org/)
